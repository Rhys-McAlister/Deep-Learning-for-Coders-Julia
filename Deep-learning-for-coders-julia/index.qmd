# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book is my work in progress interpretation of the excellent [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) book written by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger. This book is being rewritten as a way of better learning the material in addition to the Julia language as well as providing a resource to those who wish to explore deep learning in Julia.
